cafebazzar.ir responsive home page with HTML,CSS-FLEXBOX,CSS-GRID,JS

# description 

this project was created with HTML,Css,Javascript and css-flexbox and css-grid it has features such as dropdown, sliders, hamburger menu and 
scroll up button and also it is fully responsive for smaller screens like tablets and phones.
I had some challenges like how to do I code the sliders so that it will work for all of them and still be efficient.
with experiences that I had from [zoomit](https://github.com/mahan-nezafat/zoomit-landing-page) project and [sheypoor](https://github.com/mahan-nezafat/sheypoor-landing-page)
project I was able to overcome them.
